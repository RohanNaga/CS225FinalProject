# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
2 to 3 times a week at our apartment generally on mondays wednesdays and fridays. We will spend 15-30 meetings to set goals, and recap progress.
2. **Assistance** 
We have a text group chat and responses will be almost immediate or up to an hour.
3. **Respect** 
We are all good friends and have close enough relationships to be able to speak freely and openly. We understand that all feedback is constructive and not personal.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will assign a project manager to spread the workload evenly and asssign work based on the individuals strengths and weaknesses so that we can all improve. The divide and conquer approach will be difficult for this project, so we will do code reviews at our meetings to make sure the parts all fit tooghether to make a succesful project.
5. **Time Commitment** 
We are still unsure about the exact time requirements but will set out ample time per week to create and review our code. If one person is unable to meet their deadlines we will have another person be a back up so that work is still completed.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will take votes to solve subjective conflicts with the project manager being the deciding vote in a tie. We will also handle all debates civily by presenting evidence rather than becoming aggresive. We will also discuss with our mentor for advice on the best path to choose.
